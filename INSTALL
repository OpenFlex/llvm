0. Install LLVM and clang (or llvm-gcc). You need llvm from SVN trunk
   (r57989 or newer).

1. $ phpize

2. $ ./configure --enable-phpllvm --with-php-source=/path/to/php/sources/

3. $ make && sudo make install

4. Copy "module_template.bc" to your current working directory before you run:

    $ php -dextension=phpllvm.so your_script.php

    After each execution, you can examine the generated LLVM in the current
    working directory with:

    $ llvm-dis -o - previous_execution.bc

    To enable the debug mode, add "-DDEBUG_PHPLLVM" to both CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS


Note: if you use gcc >= 4.0 to compile PHP, you need to disable the -fvisibility option
      by directly patching the configure script. We'll soon provide a configure option
      to disable it without patching.
